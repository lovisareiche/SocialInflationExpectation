# Social Inflation Expectation
A project to analyse the effect of networks on inflation expectations

## Preparation Files
Here are the files we need to shape the data in the right format so they can run from a1-a3.
Run these first to set up all the datasets needed for the codes below.

## Main Codes

### a1: Creates SPI and PPI
Creates the indices needed in the regression using social and physical proximity between geographical units and their inflation expectations

### a2: Combines all variables to allow for a panel regression
Creates a combined dataset and runs a number of regression specifications

### a3: Case Study
Identifies inflation events and checks how connectedness to this region impacts expectations
