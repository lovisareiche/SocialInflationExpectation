# Social Inflation Expectation
A project to analyse the effect of networks on inflation expectations

## Codes

### a1: Prepares all data sets
Since we are using commuting zones as geographical unit we have to convert the SCI index, covariates and distance measures

### a2: Combines all variables to allow for a panel regression
Creates a combined dataset and runs fixed effects regression
